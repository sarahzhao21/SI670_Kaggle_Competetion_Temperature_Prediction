# SI670_Kaggle_Competetion_Temperature_Prediction_Team-Libra

Context:
Lake monitoring provides important information for environment protection and pollution identification, such as temperature/thermal monitoring. In this Kaggle task, the instructor will provide thermal sensor data for multiple lakes and ask you to predict/estimate the temperature at a certain depth for certain lakes.

Content:
The instructor provide Lake Troutâ€™s data during the period of Apr 20th, 2012 - Apr 19th, 2018. There will be multiple sensors at different depths, and we will provide lake_id, time, depth and the corresponding temperature at this depth and time point. 

Task:
Predicting/estimating the temperature of Trout Lake at depth 10.5 m during Apr 20th, 2018 - Apr 19th, 2019. Please feel free to use part of/all the data we provide. 
Benchmark 1:  MSE < 0.065
Benchmark 2:  MSE < 0.032

Result: Team-Libra (Team member: Sarah Zhao) get the MSE: 0.02451, ranked the 13th among the 48 teams in this competetion.
I used the Ridge regression model and dimention expantion to solve this problem.
